Equicord is designed with user privacy in mind and doesn’t collect or share any personal data. Since it’s an extension for Discord, it operates entirely within the Discord platform. This means all interactions and data management follow Discord’s privacy policies, which you can check out at [discord.com/privacy](https://discord.com/privacy/). So, while Equicord doesn’t handle your data, it’s a good idea to review Discord’s policy to understand how your information is managed. This setup ensures transparency and follows standard practices for third-party tools working within larger platforms.
