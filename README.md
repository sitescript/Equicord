## Installing Equicord Devbuild

### Dependencies
[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) and [Node.JS LTS](https://nodejs.dev/en/) are required.

Install `pnpm`:

> :exclamation: This next command may need to be run as admin/root depending on your system, and you may need to close and reopen your terminal for pnpm to be in your PATH.

```shell
npm i -g pnpm
```

> :exclamation: **IMPORTANT** Make sure you aren't using an admin/root terminal from here onwards. It **will** mess up your Discord/Equicord instance and you **will** most likely have to reinstall.

Clone Equicord:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Equicord/Equicord
cd Equicord
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

pnpm build
```
Inject Equicord into your client:

```shell
pnpm inject
```

<summary>Using Equicord violates Discord's terms of service</summary>

Client modifications are against Discord’s Terms of Service.

However, Discord is pretty indifferent about them and there are no known cases of users getting banned for using client mods! So you should generally be fine if you don’t use plugins that implement abusive behaviour. But no worries, all inbuilt plugins are safe to use!

Regardless, if your account is essential to you and getting disabled would be a disaster for you, you should probably not use any client mods (not exclusive to Equicord), just to be safe

Additionally, make sure not to post screenshots with Equicord in a server where you might get banned for it
